// For now, assuming it's globally available or will be handled if/when these functions are fleshed out.
// If this script itself becomes a module and patchExerciseForRandomizeButton is from utils.js (non-module), this could be an issue.
// However, the current task is only to add 'export' to showStoryPractice and showInterestingFactPractice.

// If patchExerciseForRandomizeButton is not module-aware, these lines might need adjustment later:
// showStoryPractice = patchExerciseForRandomizeButton(showStoryPractice, '.reading-exercise-container', startRandomReadingPractice);
// showInterestingFactPractice = patchExerciseForRandomizeButton(showInterestingFactPractice, '.reading-exercise-container', startRandomReadingPractice);

// Re-assigning potentially non-exported patched versions. If these were exported, the exports should be of the patched versions.
// For now, this file isn't a module itself, so direct assignment is fine.
// If it becomes a module, and these are exported, ensure the exported versions are the patched ones.
// For this step, we only export the functions, patching is a pre-existing detail.
